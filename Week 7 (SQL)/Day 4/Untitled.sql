-- 26/2/24 Selecting Data From Multiple Tables

-- Union -- Join 

-- the union operator is used the result of multiple select queries
-- use union to combine the data of multiple tables as one single table

-- union  will not replicate duplicate data, the new table column names will be from the first sekect query table.
-- union all will replicate duplicate data.

-- union will be used if you have a store report for each month in a separated table
